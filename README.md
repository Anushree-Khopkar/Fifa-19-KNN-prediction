# KNN-prediction

## Introduction
This is a project based on the FIFA World Cup 2019. We did Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on dataset and derived some important conclusions that are integral in making decisions for the next season. We have applied KNN algorithm to solve our problem statement. 
 
## Problem Definition
How accurately can we tell the position of the player just knowing physical and technical features of a player?

## Machine Learning Model
The Machine Learning model we used for this project is KNN Classifier. KNN is the simplest but powerful classification algorithm. It is one of the most used learning algorithms. 
KNN is non-parametric algorithm. Its purpose is to use database in which the data points are separated into several classes to predict the classification of new sample point. 

## Result and Conclusion
The results got:
1. With 86% accuracy we can predict players position just knowing physical and technical features.
2. Misclassification is around 14%.
